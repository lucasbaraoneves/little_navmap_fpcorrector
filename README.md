# little_navmap_fpcorrector
This program aims to correct the problem of custom waypoints generated by Little Navmap pointing to the north pole of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Basically there is a difference between the lnmp and msfs generated flight plans, a missing <ICAO> node in lnmp exported flight plans.
This program runs all files in the flight plan directory and injects this node, so the flightplans don't point anymore do the north pole.

Use at your own risk.
